This README describes how to install and run the "Debgrind" tool, based 
on Valgrind.

There is a dockerfile included in this repository at docker/Dockerfile.
If you have a base docker image that is based on Ubuntu, you can change
the "FROM" line in the dockerfile to the name of your base image to build a
new image with the tools installed.

From inside the docker directory, where valgrind-tools is the name of the new
docker image:
> docker build . -t valgrind-tools


Alternately, you can execute the following commands on Ubuntu, after
setting an appropriate PARENT_DIR:

apt-get install automake make autoconf git g++ libc6-dbg
cd $PARENT_DIR
git clone https://github.com/squaresLab/valgrind-tools.git
cd $PARENT_DIR/valgrind-tools
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=$PARENT_DIR/valgrind-bin
make install


To run the tool on the program "date":
$PARENT_DIR/valgrind-bin/bin/valgrind --trace-children=yes --tool=debgrind --output-file=output_filename.out date
